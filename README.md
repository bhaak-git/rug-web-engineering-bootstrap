# Adding Bootstrap to a Vue Project
by Bastiaan Haaksema

The default branch of this repository will be the inital point of the demonstration. If you want to take a look at the final result, and the steps it took to get there, swich to the [tutorial-steps](https://github.com/bhaak-git/rug-web-engineering-bootstrap/tree/tutorial-steps) branch.

For this project [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) is required. You should install npm before the live tutorial begins if you would like to follow along.

In order to include all the modules needed for Vue and Bootstrap the following command must be executed in the project root.
```
npm install
```

To compile and view the project in the browser you can use the following command. By default hot reloading is enabled, which means the web page automatically refreshes once you save your changes.
```
npm run serve
```

Once your application is ready for production you can run the following command. This will minify you files which helps with performance.
```
npm run build
```
